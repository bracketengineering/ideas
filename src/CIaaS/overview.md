# Cloud Infrastructure Drag and Drop(IaaS)

## The Idea

To put it simply, think of SquareSpace or WebFlow but for Cloud Infrastructure.

## The Problem

One of the largest barriers to entry for people starting out with cloud computing is knowing
which services to use, how they all work, how to link them together, how to make your system secure, 
and how to do all of this while optimising for cost and performance.

## The solution

We would build a platform that provided a drag and drop interface for the main cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP etc.),
with support for multiple compute options, databases, APIs, VPCs and Machine Learning Integration.

## Use Cases

- Start-Ups and other small/medium sized business that do not have a specialised DevOps/Cloud Architect
- Any Software Developer or Cloud Architect who works in any sized team who wants to:
    - Test their front-end platform with a mock backend
    - Test a configuration of cloud infrastructure with a wider system
    - Use to very easily configure a secure, powerful cloud infrastructure

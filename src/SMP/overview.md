# System Managment Platform

## The Idea

## The Problem

## The Solution


Systems management platform to manage space colonies that will be initially made up of autonomous robots.

- The platform would also be made so that it could be run on any device via a virtual machine installed on every device in the system. We would build the software with the input and output in a single, standardised form to ensure interoperability between all devices, software and programming languages.
- The installed software would also contain irremovable fail-safe software that would provide devices with a backup of what to do if something went wrong while the signal to the rest of the system was lost.
- The platform would use blockchain-style validation to verify the state of the system making it virtually resistant to tampering. This would also allow the state of the system to be known without having to talk directly to the main computer(s).
- The platform could be expanded from being used with just robots to any kind of device or sensor. This would allow entire infrastructures, made of all kinds of devices and software, to be managed via a single platform.
- We would use deep learning along with a variety of data points such as location, orientation, speed, power, charging speed, the torque of motors, power consumption, efficiency, and any other sensor readings to preemptively predict when something may go wrong.

## Use Cases


- MAIN USE: Space cities that use fleets of autonomous robots to build infrastructure
**Other Uses:**
- Virtical farms that are monitored by sensors
- Large company vehicle fleets that need to be monitored
- Autonomous warehouse robots
